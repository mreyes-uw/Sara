The files below are from a Machine Learning class I took that was focused on the applications of machine learning.
Each file has it's own descriptors of what each project entailed.

### Lab 1 introduces neural networks
### Lab 2 introduces pytorch
### Lab 3 introduces FCN
### Lab 4 introduces CNN
### Lab 5 introduces RNN
### Lab 6 introduces Encode-Decoder RNN's
### Lab 8 is a final project using deep learning to distinguish between images of brains with tumors and no tumors
